What is the DICOM file format and how does it relate to computer vision?  

A little while ago I decided to undertake a computer vision project to detect abnormalities in brain CT scans by utilizing 3-dimensional [convolutional neural networks](https://jason-adam.github.io/convolutions/). Admittedly, this was a little more ambitious than I had time for, but it was a great learnring experience, and it forced me to work on pre-processing skills due to the nature of the file formats that certain medical images come in. This leads me to the DICOM file format for medical imaging.
