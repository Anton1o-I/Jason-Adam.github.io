What is a Convolutional Neural Network?  

I recently took a Computer Vision class (2019) as one of my electives in my graduate program at Northwestern University, and I found it to be the most beneficial class in the entire program from an applied perspective. The class was a little light on theory, but it more than made up for it with it's focus on utilizing cloud computing and IoT devices to bring inference to the edge. I've done a fair amount of reading in the last few months about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but I've been looking for a way to start consolidating my knowledge so that I can recall it and reference it later as the need arises.  

The main book that I've been reading (and the one referenced repeatedly in this write-up) is [Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-rosebrock-59b8732a/). Adrian is a leader in the Computer Vision space, and he regularly puts out outstanding content (tutorials, books, etc.) on the topic. The book is very approachable and is packed full of knowledge.  

With that being said, the path through this post will be a condensed version of Chapter 11. Convolutional Neural Networks, for those of you that have the book, and I'll cover:  

* What are Convolutions?  
* What are Kernels?  
* What are the Layer Types in a CNN?  
* Rules of Thumb for Building CNNs  

## What are Convolutions?  
The term "Convolution" is right in the name of the neural network architecture people use for computer vision problems, but it seems some don't necessarily understand what this actually is. An image convolution can loosely be defined as an **element-wise multiplication of two matrices followed by a sum** (Rosebrock, 2017, pp. 171). For those of you that are familiar with any sort of image processing, it will come as no surprise that images are just multidimensional matrices. Color images have a depth of 3 (a layer each for RGB), and Grayscale images have a depth of 1 (all pixels are on the same color scale). In the context of CNNs, there is a smaller matrix called the kernel that slides left-to-right and top-to-bottom across the image matrix and convolves at each location. This leads us to Kernels which are designed to perform various image processing functions. There are many filters (kernels) that have been defined by hand, and we'll get to those next, but the goal of the CNN is to learn these filters automatically. Below is Figure 11.1 (Rosebrock, 2017) from the book, and it does a good job representing the kernel sliding across the image.

## What are Kernels?  
Kernels (or filters) are small square matrices that slide across the image matrix, convolving at each step. What does this really mean? If we reference the image above, we have a small square matrix with pre-specified values that just element-wise multiplication with the image pixel values, then takes the sum. This single sum (i.e. the output value) is stored at the same coordinates as the center of the kernel. The goal of the kernel is to reduce the spatial dimensions of the image and perform some image processing task. Kernels always are an odd sized square matrix so that there is a clear center value (i.e. $3x3$ or $5x5$). Below is a simple example from the book regarding how a kernel slides across the image matrix and performs the convolution. This involves a $3x3$ kernel used for blurring.  

$$
O_{i,j}=\frac{1}{9}*\[\begin{bmatrix}
1&1&1\\
1&1&1\\
1&1&1\\
\end{bmatrix\]*\[\begin{bmatrix}
93&139&101\\
26&252&196\\
135&230&18\\
\end{bmatrix\]
$$  

This results in the following matrix after the element-wise multiplication. We can then take the sum.  

$$
O_{i,j}=\sum \[\begin{bmatrix}
10.3&15.4&11.2\\
2.8&&28.0&21.7\\
15.0&25.5&2.0\\
\end{bmatrix}\]\approx 132
$$

There are several common kernels that are used for different processing tasks:  

1. Blurring  
2. Sharpen
