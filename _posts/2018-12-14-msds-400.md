## Math For Data Scientists
Hello, and thanks for reading!  This is the first part in a 12 part data science series.  This series is intended to chronicle my journey through the Data Science graduate program at Northwestern University.

Math for Data Scientists (MSDS-400) was the first class I completed in my Data Science graduate program at Northwestern University.  The class was designed as a primer/refresher for some of the foundational mathematic concepts used for various modeling techniques.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

for i in range(1:11):
	print(i)
```
