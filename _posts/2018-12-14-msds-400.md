## Math For Data Scientists
Hello, and thanks for reading!  This is the first part in a 12 part data science series.  This series is intended to chronicle my journey through the Data Science graduate program at Northwestern University.

Math for Data Scientists (MSDS-400) was the first class I completed in my Data Science graduate program.  The class was designed as a primer/refresher for foundational mathematic concepts used with various modeling techniques.

The core objectives for the class were:  
1. Apply linear programming methods to real world models.
2. Analyze and interpret mathematical models.
3. Create graphs and trees to model real world problems.
4. Calculate and analyze derivatives and integrals of real world models.
5. Evaluate and interpret probabilistic models.

The majority of the class was spent working on linear algebra and calculus.  We took a brief break between these two areas to study algorithms and graph theory.  I'll go into more detail on each of these pieces throughout this article.  Let's dive right in!

### Apply Linear Programming Methods to Real World Models

The course started out with a relatively basic review of linear functions.  We reviewed simple slope calculations such as the point-slope form:
$$
y - y_{1}=m(x-x_{1})
$$
Where $m$ equals the slope of the line that passes through $(x_{1},y_{1}$
