## Math For Data Scientists
Hello, and thanks for reading!  This will be the first part in a 12 part data science series.  I'll be chronicling my journey through the Data Science Graduate program at Northwestern University.

Math for Data Scientists (MSDS-400) was the first class I completed in my Data Science graduate program at Northwestern University.  The class was designed as a primer/refresher

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

for i in range(1:11):
	print(i)
```
