### Reason For This Blog's Existence

Hello, and thanks for reading!  My name is Jason, and if you've managed to stumble upon this site, then it means you have a passion for data science just like I do.  I created this blog for a couple of reasons.  First, I wanted a creative outlet for any interesting data science projects that I work on.  It's important in this field to craft your project/analysis/model in a way that is easily consumed by technical and non-technical folks alike.  Second, I wanted a place to chronicle my journey through the Data Science graduate program at Northwestern University.  My hope is that it will inspire others to pursue something that they are passionate about and find interesting!

### Background & Bio

I'm originally from Texas, but I spent most of my life in Wisconsin.  I grew up in a small town of about 30k called West Bend and attended U.W. Oshkosh for my undergraduate studies.  Like most kids at 18, I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.  I ended up graduating with a degree in Biology but knew that a life in the lab was not where I wanted to be.  Biology is a diverse and fascinating field, but the practicality of a career path didn't seem evident.  I ended up moving to Arizona after graduation in 2011 and, it was at this time that I started work on my M.B.A. through the University of Phoenix.  I graduated from the program in 2013 and have worked in various business development and analytics roles since then.  As of the writing of this section I'm pursing my Master of Science degree in Data Science (MSDS) through Northwestern University with an expected graduation of Spring 2020.

When I'm not studying or reading up on various data science topics, I'm spending time with my wife and daughter here in sunny Scottsdale.
