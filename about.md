### Another Data Science Blog?

Hello, and thanks for reading! My name is Jason, and if you've managed to stumble upon this site, then it means you have an interest in data science just like I do. I created this blog for the purpose of documenting things I've learned throughout my Masters program at Northwestern University as well as other DS-related things I find helpful or interesting. If you spot anything on the site that doesn't look quite right, feel free to reach out to me via email (link at the bottom). We're all human, and occasionally I goof up the logic or have a bug in my code. Learning is a lifelong process! 

### Background & Bio

I was born in Texas, but I grew up in Wisconsin. I relocated to Phoenix in 2011 after undergrad, but I currently live in Scottsdale with my wife and daughter. We enjoy spending as much time outdoors as possible when the weather permits. It took me quite a while to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, but I really feel like I've zeroed in on a career that I find enjoyable and challenging.
