After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either 2 or 4. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of 2048. One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it. My current algorithm: What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values 2 and 4, that is, I try to have 2 and 4 tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good. But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?\n"
