    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a well known graph algorithm used to find the fastest path from start to finish. Below is a small graph to illustrate the point. The green path is the fastest path from start to finish, while the blue path represents the shortest path (in terms of edges traversed).  \n",

    "This example is extremely basic, and it's easy to see the solution without an algorithm, but as the graph grows in size this becomes impossible. This is where Dijkstra's algorithm comes into play. Below are the general steps of the algorithm (I'll explain each in a little more depth below) [1].  \n",
