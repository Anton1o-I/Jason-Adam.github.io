    "Small post about recursion basics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. It can be a very elegant way to solve a problem, but understanding it eludes a great many folks. In order to understand recursion, we have to take a step back and understand a different fundamental concept first --> *The Stack*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Call Stack  \n",
    "The stack is a simple data structure that encompasses two basic functions.  \n",
    "1. Push -> add a new item to the top  \n",
    "2. Pop -> remove the top-most item and read it  \n",
    "Computer's implement this data structure in the form of the *Call Stack*. The call stack acts as a sort of record in memory for a function call. When a function contains a nested function, the top-level function is paused in a partially completed state until the inner function returns. Only when all inner functions have been satisfied can the top-level function return. Each inner function gets **stacked** on the base function (hence the name) and **popped** once they return.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've defined what a stack is, let's demonstrate both of these concepts with a popular example, [Euclid's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). Euclid's Algorithm is a well-known way for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers, and it is an excellent use-case for recursion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Euclid's Algorithm  \n",
    "Euclid's algorithm is an elegant solution to finding the greates common divisor of two numbers. The algorithm takes the following steps:  \n",
    "1. Check if the smaller number can be evenly divided into the larger number -> if it can, the GCD is the smaller number.\n",
    "2. If the smaller number can't be divided into the larger number, take the difference between the two and compare to the smaller number again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This turns out to be a very simple, yet powerful approach, and it lends itself nicely to recursion. Recursion can loosely be defined as a function that calls itself. It is made up of two cases:  \n",
    "* Base Case -> the termination criteria  \n",
    "* Recursive Case -> Criteria to repeat the function call until the base case is met  \n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion uses the call stack, and it can become very memory intensive if you're not careful. Each recursive call is added to call stack until the base case is met. If the recursive function requires many repeated calls, the call stack will grow quite large.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a better understanding of recursion and the call stack, let's write out the algorithm."

    "This flow is very similar to how the call stack will look for the recursive call. Each successive call will add to the top of the stack until the base case is met.
